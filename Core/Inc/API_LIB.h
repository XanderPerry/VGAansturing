/**
 * @brief Draws a line with adjustable thickness on the VGA display.
 *
 * This function implements Bresenham's line algorithm to efficiently draw a line
 * between two points using only integer arithmetic. Line thickness is achieved by
 * drawing a filled circle (brush) at each point along the path.
 *
 * @param x_1     	Starting X-coordinate of the line.
 * @param y_1     	Starting Y-coordinate of the line.
 * @param x_2     	Ending X-coordinate of the line.
 * @param y_2     	Ending Y-coordinate of the line.
 * @param weight  	Thickness of the line in pixels. The value represents the diameter;
 *                	internally, a circle with radius = weight/2 is drawn as the brush.
 * @param color   	8-bit color value used to draw the line.
 * @param reserved	Reserved variable
 *
 * @note This function calls API_draw_circle() to simulate line thickness.
 *       For very large weights, performance may decrease due to repeated circle drawing.
 *
 * @warning No boundary checking is performed. Ensure that the line (including brush size)
 *          fits within the display memory region to avoid invalid pixel writes.

/**
 * @brief Draws a filled circle on the VGA display.
 *
 * This function uses the midpoint circle algorithm to draw a filled circle
 * centered at the specified coordinates. The circle is filled by drawing
 * horizontal spans between symmetric points on each iteration.
 *
 * @param x0     	X-coordinate of the circle center.
 * @param y0     	Y-coordinate of the circle center.
 * @param radius 	Radius of the circle in pixels.
 * @param color  	16-bit color value used to fill the circle.
 * @parma reserved	Reserved variable
 *
 * @note This function requires the UB_VGA_SetPixel() function to be
 *       available for setting individual pixels on the display.
 *
 * @warning No boundary checking is performed. Ensure the circle fits
 *          within the screen to avoid memory access errors.
